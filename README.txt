# FIRST EXERCISE PROJECT FOR DATA STRUCTURES AND ANALYSIS II - 2024

## As an student, 8 functions were given to us. The following points will explain each one of them

### VizinhosEmComum(Grafo* g, int v, int* vizinhos);
- this function is used to store the common neighbors between a vertex v and i, being i the index in the array vizinhos (neighbors) which contains
the value of the intersection.

### coeficienteDeJaccard(Grafo* g, int v, int* vizinhos);
- following the same logic behind the last fuction, here we store the jaccard's coefficient as floating points

### AdamicAdar(Grafo* g, int v, float* coeficientes);
- this function calculates the AdamicAdar coefficient and stores the results in an array of floating numbers

### alocacaoDeRecursos(Grafo* g, int v, float* coeficientes);
- this function calculates de resources allocation coefficient and stores it in an array of floating numbers

### similaridadeCosseno(Grafo* g, int v, float* coeficientes);
- this function calculates the cosine similarity and stores the result in an array of floating numbers

### coeficienteDeDice(Grafo* g, int v, float* coeficientes);
- this function calculates the Dice coefficient and stores the result in an array of floating numbers

### HPI(Grafo* g, int v, float* coeficientes);
- this function calculates the high promoted index and stores the result in an array of floating numbers

### HDI(Grafo* g, int v, float* coeficientes);
- this function calculates the hhub depressed index and stores the result in an array of floating numbers
